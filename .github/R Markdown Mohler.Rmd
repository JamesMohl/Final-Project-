## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
---

---
```{r}
#This part of my file will be dedicated to importing the data, the library parmeters, and extraneous information I will want to include before beginning my code. 
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(actuar)
library(ggmap)


```

## Including Plots

```
```{r}
#There are so many ways to import data since this relies on excel and wbe applications so I am including a series of ways in which a user kight prefer to import the data or different sets.
deforestation_data <- function() {
  url <- "https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/country/BRA/?category=forest-change&location=WyJjb3VudHJ5IiwiQlJBIl0%3D"
  
  # Read HTML content from the webpage
  webpage <- read_html(url)
  
  # Extract table data
  table_data <- html_table(html_nodes(webpage, "table"))[[1]]
  
  # Clean data if necessary
  
  return(table_data)
}

# Fetch deforestation data
deforestation_data <- fetch_deforestation_data()


# Manually extract information from the document

# Dataset Name
dataset_name <- "Global Forest Watch"

# Description
description <- "Global Forest Watch (GFW) is an online platform that provides data and tools for monitoring forests worldwide. It offers a variety of datasets related to forest cover, deforestation, forest fires, and other forest-related metrics."

# Print extracted information
cat("Dataset Name:", dataset_name, "\n")
cat("Description:", description, "\n")
cat("Data Access:", data_access, "\n")
cat("Data Processing:", data_processing, "\n")
cat("Metadata:", metadata, "\n")
cat("Usage Policies:", usage_policies, "\n")

# URL of the data download link
download_url <- "https://storage.googleapis.com/earthenginepartners-hansen/GFC-2023-v1.11/download.html"

# Destination file path where you want to save the downloaded file
destination_path <- "GFC-2023-v1.11.zip"

# Download the file
download.file(download_url, r.data, mode = "wb")

# Check if the download was successful
if (file.exists(mohle)) {
  cat("Download successful. File saved as:", r.data, "\n")
} else {
  cat("Download failed.\n")
}
urlToRead <- "https://glad.earthengine.app/view/global-forest-change"

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
